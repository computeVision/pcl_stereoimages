# Rigid Motion Estimation
Point Cloud Reproduction from Stereoimages.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown)  

Source: https://github.com/computeVision/pcl_stereoimages/blob/master/doc/report.pdf

Given a sequence of stereo images you have to compute the translation and rotation between consecutive
recordings. This transformations are then utilized to fuse the individual dense depth estimations.
